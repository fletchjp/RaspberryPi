# First Raspberry Pi project

I cannot figure out how to connect this to my GitHub repositories.

The previous password usage has been discontinued.

I have been able to copy a version of this file to the Mini PC and add it to the repository. That is not ideal.

The copying is done using a samba share through a shared folder /srv/shared-folder.

I have to copy to it using sudo cp xyz /srv/shared-folder

It then pops up in the shared drive on the Mini PC.

I have not yet found out how to do the opposite transfer,

I do have access to the whole of the drive on the Raspberry Pi to copy from but not too.
